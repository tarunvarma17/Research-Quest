# Research-Quest

## The Goal of Research Quest
Our goal is to put the power of cutting-edge AI and Large Language Models in the hands of the everyday researcher. This product will allow the user to leverage the latest NLP techniques in order to answer any of their research oriented doubts and questions in an efficient manner. This can be used by researchers who wish to get short and succint answers to their queries, and saves hours of precious time that would otherwise be spent meticulously going through the paper in search of the relevant paragraph.

## How to use Research Quest
Note: Ensure you have at least 20 GB of GPU memory.
1. Install the necessary dependencies (most importantly, HuggingFace, Pytorch, LangChain)
2. Run the frontend file (fe.py). Use the command "streamlit run /fe.py"
3. Run the backend file (be.py). Use the command "python be.py"
4. Upload the desired research paper in the form of a pdf file at the top of the screen.
5. Give the file a name (this field is optional and can be ignored).
6. Click Send and wait 2-3 minutes for the model to respond!
